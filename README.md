ðŸ¤“ About Me
-----------------------------
For as long as I can remember, I've loved solving problems, learning new things, and helping others. I've built custom PCs for both myself and friends, taught myself Python to create a pantry-management app, and know how to tackle everything from Windows 10/11 and macOS troubleshooting to DNS and email configuration. I'm CompTIA A+ certified and currently studying for Network+ next. Skilled in Active Directory, ServiceNow/Jira ticketing, remote support (RDP, VPN, TeamViewer) and clear technical documentation.

I have deep customer service experience. From assisting hundreds of customers to supporting students and faculty with hardware, printing, and video conferencing setups. I stay calm under pressure, communicate step by step, and turn frustrated users into satisfied ones. I'm passionate about continuous learning and ready to bring my hands-on IT support expertise to you.
